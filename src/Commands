JUnit it .jar package

The JUnit package should be placed inside the same directory as the .java files for ease, then you'd
use the following commands to compile and run your code.

    Compile:

    javac -cp "junit-platform-console-standalone-1.8.2.jar" *.java

    Run:

    java -jar junit-platform-console-standalone-1.8.2.jar -cp .\ -c StackTest


Each test should follow the Arrange, Act, Assert structure

    Arrange:
        - Setup the preconditions for the test
        - Initialize any necessary objects
        - Configure any dependencies
        - If necessary, Ensure the system is in a known state before executing the test

    Act:
        - This is where the actual test action or operation is performed
        - Typically involves invoking the method or function being tested
        - Executes the specific behaviour that is under examination

    Assert:
        - After the action has been performed
        - Verify that the actual outcome of the test matches the expected result
        - Validate the behaviour of the system to determine whether the test has passed or failed based on predefined criteria
